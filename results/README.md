# results

This folder is for computational experiments performed on the data. Each experiment should be in **a separate folder** dated in YYYY-MM-DD format with a camel case name (see below). Experiments should be written in Rmarkdown (`.Rmd`) or Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) format.


    YYYY-MM-DD_MyExperiment
    ├──Step1.Rmd
    ├──plot1.jpg
    ├──plot2.jpg
    ├──some_stats.csv
    └──Step2_in-progress.Rmd


The notebook files should inlude the following components. Mark "in-progress" in the file name if it is incomplete
1. The question being asked
2. A broad overview of the approach being used
3. The code written addressing the question, with informative descriptions and comments interspersed

The folder should include results and plots. The only tabular data stored here should be statistics.
