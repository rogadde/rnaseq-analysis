Project Background
-------------------
In their study "Transcriptomic Profiling of Microglia and Astrocytes Throughout Amicroglia and astrocytes from both WT and AD mouse brains at 5 different time points to study gene expression throughout aging. In this project, I will use their reads to perform my own RNA-seq analysis.
